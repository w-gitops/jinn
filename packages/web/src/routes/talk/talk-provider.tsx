/**
 * Jinn Talk — state provider lifted ABOVE the router.
 *
 * `useTalk()` is called once here, mounted outside <Routes> (in
 * client-providers.tsx), so the WS subscription, audio player, transcript,
 * threads and cards stay alive across `/` ↔ `/talk` navigation instead of being
 * destroyed when TalkPage unmounts. TalkPage consumes this via useTalkContext().
 *
 * The hook's heavy bootstrap (creating the orchestrator session, probing TTS,
 * rehydrating) is gated behind `activate()` — which TalkPage calls on mount — so
 * the provider being globally mounted does NOT spin up a talk session for users
 * who never open /talk.

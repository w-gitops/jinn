/**
 * Jinn Talk — streamed audio player (Phase 2 real loop).
 *
 * Plays base64-encoded audio chunks (a complete WAV per sentence from the local
 * Kokoro TTS backend) IN ARRIVAL ORDER with low latency, and exposes an
 * AnalyserNode so the AURA orb can react to the REAL output audio (RMS level)
 * while it speaks.
 *
 * Design:
 *  - One shared AudioContext (created lazily, resumed on the first user gesture).
 *  - Each `talk:audio` frame is a SELF-CONTAINED WAV. `seq` is monotonic WITHIN a
 *    turn (it counts up from each speak's `seqStart`), and `last:true` rides only
 *    the turn's FINAL frame. We don't gate playback on `seq` — frames arrive in
 *    order over a single WS connection, so we play them in arrival order — but we
 *    DO watch `last` to re-arm cleanly at the turn boundary (a frame after a
 *    `last:true` is turn N+1's first frame: reset the drained-run latch and
 *    resume a suspended context before scheduling it).
 *  - Decode + schedule is serialized on a promise chain so the moving "playhead"
 *    clock stays correct and chunks are scheduled back-to-back with no gaps,
 *    clicks, or overlaps — regardless of how fast each chunk decodes.
 *  - Every source routes through a single AnalyserNode → destination, giving the
 *    page a continuous signal to read regardless of which chunk is playing.
 *  - `onIdle` fires once the queue fully drains (used to settle the avatar).
 *
 * Decode errors are swallowed per-chunk (we skip the bad chunk) so playback
 * never stalls on one corrupt frame.

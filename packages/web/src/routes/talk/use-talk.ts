/**
 * Jinn Talk — real voice-loop hook (Path 1).
 *
 * The voice orchestrator is a REAL gateway session (source:"talk"). Loop:
 *   mic → useStt → POST /api/sessions/{orchestratorId}/message
 *        → the orchestrator streams its reply as session:delta `text` (caption)
 *          and is spoken aloud. TTS is browser SpeechSynthesis by default (works
 *          on iOS/Android, no server deps); if the gateway ever streams Kokoro
 *          audio (talk:audio) we prefer that instead.
 *        → when it delegates to a COO child, the gateway emits talk:focus; we
 *          track that child so the UI can render it as a satellite orb.
 *        → when a COO child finishes, the orchestrator is woken (📩) and narrates
 *          — another session:delta + spoken turn.
 *
 * Mic control is plain tap-to-talk: tap the mic to start listening, tap again to
 * send. After a reply is spoken the loop returns to idle and waits for the next tap.

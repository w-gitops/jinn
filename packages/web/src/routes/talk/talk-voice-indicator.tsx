/**
 * Jinn Talk — neural-vs-fallback voice indicator.
 *
 * A tiny dot + label showing which voice produced the last spoken turn:
 *   • "Neural" — the gateway streamed Kokoro audio and it played.
 *   • "Fallback" — the browser Web-Speech synth (Kokoro absent/unavailable).
 * Driven by useTalk's `voiceMode` (set per turn from whether talk:audio arrived).
 * Renders nothing until the first turn has been spoken, so it stays invisible
 * on the calm idle surface.
 *
 * Note: it deliberately does NOT show a "Muted" state — the active top-right mute
 * button already conveys that, so a bottom chip would be redundant. When muted,
 * `voiceMode` is null, so this renders nothing.

/**
 * Jinn Talk — per-channel visual identity (pure, testable).
 *
 * Every COO child the orchestrator patches to is a "channel". Each channel gets
 * a stable colour signature derived deterministically from a key (the child's
 * label when known — e.g. "content-lead" — else its session id), so the same COO
 * always wears the same hue: the main orb borrows it while patched, and the
 * satellite orb is painted with it.
 *
 * Only a HUE is derived (0..360). It is mapped into a non-amber arc so every
 * channel reads as clearly distinct from AURA's own neutral amber identity.
 * No colour-space math here — the avatar turns the hue into pixels; this module
 * is just the deterministic key → hue mapping, kept pure so it can be tested.

/**
 * Jinn Talk — pure stream-text helpers.
 *
 * Within one orchestrator turn the engine can emit MULTIPLE text content
 * blocks (e.g. narration before and after a tool call). The deltas arrive as
 * raw fragments with no separator at block boundaries, so naive concatenation
 * renders "…the Platform Lead now.On it. I'll surface…". We can't see block
 * boundaries from the delta stream, but a boundary is recognizable in the
 * text itself: accumulated text ending in sentence punctuation followed by a
 * fragment starting with a non-whitespace character. Mid-sentence token
 * deltas never look like that (they carry their own leading space), so the
 * heuristic is safe to run on every append.
 *
 * NOTE: the rehydrate path (rehydrate.ts) reads the server-persisted turn
 * text, which is already joined server-side — this helper is for the LIVE
 * delta accumulation only.

 * `jinn restart` — race-free, in-session-safe gateway restart.

 * Forks a detached helper that does stop → wait-for-port-free → start out of
 * band, so it survives the gateway killing its own sessions. Safe to run from
 * inside a Jinn chat session: this command returns immediately, the helper
 * brings the gateway back, and the gateway resumes the interrupted session.

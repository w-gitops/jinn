/**
 * Jinn Talk — orchestrator engine resolution with seamless fallback.
 *
 * The /talk voice orchestrator must NOT hardcode `engine:"claude"`: the operator
 * may run Codex/Antigravity/Pi instead, or have Claude uninstalled. This module
 * is the single, PURE place that decides which engine the talk session should use.
 *
 * Resolution order (first match wins):
 *   (a) config.talk.engine — the explicit talk override — IF set AND available.
 *   (b) config.engines.default — IF available.
 *   (c) the first available engine among `candidates` (in the given order).
 *   (d) NONE available → a clear sentinel ({ engine: null, reason: "none" }) so the
 *       caller can surface an actionable "no engine installed" message rather than
 *       letting a session spawn fail with a raw `engine "claude" not available`.
 *
 * It is intentionally pure: availability is injected via `isAvailable` (in
 * production this wraps resolve-bin's isInstalled), so the resolver imports
 * cleanly and is testable without spawning or probing real binaries.

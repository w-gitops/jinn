/**
 * Jinn Talk — session attachments (server side, leaf-level).
 *
 * A talk session can "adopt" ANY other session (an employee, the COO, a chat) as
 * an observe- or engage-target without owning it. Unlike delegation (which spawns
 * or continues a CHILD the talk session owns), an attachment is a soft link: the
 * orchestrator watches the target's progress (observe) and may relay a briefed
 * message to it (engage). The set is capped per talk session and PERSISTED by
 * merging a `talkAttachments` array into the talk session's existing
 * `transport_meta` JSON column, so it survives a reload.
 *
 * This module is deliberately LEAF-level: it imports no other talk module (no
 * graph.ts / delegate.ts) so T8's wake-on-completion can `import
 * { talkSessionsAttachedTo }` without a cycle. Persistence is injected
 * (getSession / updateSessionMeta) exactly like delegate.ts injects its deps;
 * the in-memory map is hydrated lazily from meta on first touch per talk session.
 * Module-level Maps + a `__resetForTest` seam follow the mute-state / tts-stream
 * precedent for per-session module state.

/**
 * Jinn Talk — server-side TTS streaming (Mission Control: per-sentence).
 *
 * As the orchestrator streams its reply, the run loop (api.ts) feeds each text
 * delta via feedTalkText(); complete sentences are synthesized IMMEDIATELY
 * (killing the old whole-turn dead air) on a per-session serial chain that
 * keeps talk:audio `seq` monotonic across the turn. flushTalkSpeech() speaks
 * the remainder with `final:true` (the only chunk allowed to carry last:true).
 * Calling feedTalkText without an emitter falls back to the legacy
 * buffer-everything behavior (everything speaks on flush).
 *
 * The Kokoro engine is a process-wide singleton shared with routes.ts (status /
 * download endpoints) so there is exactly one sidecar.

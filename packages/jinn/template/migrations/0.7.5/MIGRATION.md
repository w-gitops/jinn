# Migration: 0.7.5 (File Attachments, Mobile Sidebar, Connector Improvements)

## Summary

Releases v0.3.1 through v0.7.5 include significant gateway and dashboard improvements but **no template file changes** beyond what was covered in migrations 0.3.0 and 0.7.3. This migration exists to bump the version stamp and document the feature additions.

## Template files changed

None. All changes in this range are gateway code, web dashboard, and runtime improvements.

Update `jinn.version` in `config.yaml` from the previous migration version to `"0.7.5"`.

## Optional config additions

These config keys are supported but **not required** — the gateway uses sensible defaults:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `connectors.discord.token` | string | _(unset)_ | Discord bot token (enable Discord connector) |
| `connectors.discord.channels` | object | _(unset)_ | Channel ID → name mapping for Discord routing |
| `connectors.whatsapp.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable WhatsApp connector |
| `portal.onboarded` | boolean | `false` | Whether onboarding wizard has been completed |

These are opt-in features. Only add them if you want to use Discord or WhatsApp connectors.

## Merge instructions

1. **Config**: Update `jinn.version` to `"0.7.5"`. No other config changes required.
2. **No template file changes** — nothing to copy or merge.
3. **Database**: Schema changes are handled automatically on gateway start.

## Files

No files directory — this migration is version-stamp only.

# Security Hardening Verification Log

Worktree: `<repo-worktree>`
Test home: `<isolated-test-home>`
Test port: `8000`
Live home `~/.jinn`: **must not be modified**

## Verification pass — independent security/UX review

Date: 2026-06-24
Reviewer role: security/UX verification worker
Scope used: isolated worktree only. I did **not** read or modify the live Jinn home.

### What I inspected

- `SECURITY_HARDENING_PLAN.md`
- Gateway HTTP/API/WS code:
  - `packages/jinn/src/gateway/server.ts`
  - `packages/jinn/src/gateway/api.ts`
  - `packages/jinn/src/gateway/files.ts`
- Shared config/path/logging code:
  - `packages/jinn/src/shared/types.ts`
  - `packages/jinn/src/shared/paths.ts`
  - `packages/jinn/src/shared/logger.ts`
- Instance registry helper:
  - `packages/jinn/src/cli/instances.ts`
- Existing security-related tests:
  - `packages/jinn/src/gateway/__tests__/auth-security.test.ts`
  - `packages/jinn/src/gateway/__tests__/file-read.test.ts`
  - `packages/jinn/src/gateway/__tests__/files-security.test.ts`
  - `packages/jinn/src/shared/__tests__/redact.test.ts`
  - `packages/jinn/src/shared/__tests__/command-policy.test.ts`

### Current implementation status observed

Implementation is not yet present/complete:

- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/auth.ts` does not exist.
- HTTP API middleware currently routes all `/api/*` requests to `handleApiRequest` without gateway auth.
- WebSocket upgrades for `/ws` and `/ws/pty/:sessionId` currently have no auth gate.
- `gateway.host` can be `0.0.0.0` without an observed startup refusal/auth requirement.
- File read endpoint still explicitly reads arbitrary files with no secrets denylist/redaction.
- Logger and `/api/logs` return raw lines; no shared redactor is wired in.
- Connector inbound/proxy routes are privileged but not currently auth-gated by a gateway token.

### Tool/test result

Attempted targeted tests:

```bash
pnpm --filter jinn-cli test -- src/gateway/__tests__/auth-security.test.ts src/gateway/__tests__/file-read.test.ts src/gateway/__tests__/files-security.test.ts
```

Result: blocked before execution because this isolated worktree has no installed dependencies:

```text
sh: vitest: command not found
WARN Local package.json exists, but node_modules missing
```

No live instance was started.

## Must-fix security gaps before merge

### P0 — Auth must cover every privileged API before network exposure

Current `server.ts` routes all `/api/*` to `handleApiRequest` unauthenticated. The plan is correct, but implementation must not rely on individual route authors remembering auth.

Required behavior:

- Default local UX may be seamless, but privileged API routes must require a valid token/cookie once a token exists or when network-exposed.
- `/api/status` must remain unauthenticated and minimal.
- Bootstrap/login endpoints must be narrowly scoped.
- All mutating and sensitive reads must be covered, including sessions, config, logs, files, cron, org/skills, connector reload/incoming, model refresh, uploads, file transfer, PTY-related APIs, talk APIs, and internal non-hook endpoints.

Concrete tests:

- `GET /api/status` without auth returns 200 and contains no secrets/config paths beyond safe basics.
- `GET /api/sessions` without auth returns 401/403.
- `POST /api/sessions` without auth returns 401/403.
- `GET /api/config`, `PUT /api/config`, `GET /api/logs`, `GET /api/files/read?path=/etc/hosts`, `POST /api/files`, `POST /api/connectors/reload`, `POST /api/connectors/discord/incoming` without auth return 401/403.
- Same routes with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` succeed as appropriate.
- Denials return JSON with actionable message, not an HTML/static fallback.

### P0 — WebSocket auth is mandatory

Current `server.on("upgrade")` accepts `/ws` and `/ws/pty/:sessionId` without auth. `/ws/pty` can expose live terminal contents and should be treated as highly sensitive.

Required behavior:

- `/ws` requires the same gateway auth as privileged APIs.
- `/ws/pty/:sessionId` requires auth before resolving/attaching to a session.
- Browser UX should use cookie auth; CLI/test clients may use query token only if carefully constrained and not logged, but header/cookie is safer.
- Failed WS auth should return a clear HTTP 401 during upgrade or immediately close with a policy code; no partial attach.

Concrete tests:

- Unauthenticated `new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws")` fails.
- Authenticated cookie/header WS connects and receives ping/pong.
- Unauthenticated `/ws/pty/<existing-session>` fails without calling `attachPtyWebSocket`.
- Bad token and missing token are both rejected.

### P0 — `0.0.0.0`/non-loopback startup must refuse insecure mode by default

Plan says warn or refuse; this should be a hard fail unless auth is enabled and token exists, except with explicit escape hatch.

Required behavior:

- Default host remains `127.0.0.1`.
- `gateway.host: 0.0.0.0`, LAN IP, or Tailscale IP with missing/disabled auth must fail startup with clear instructions.
- Escape hatch must be explicit and noisy: `gateway.insecureAllowUnauthenticatedNetwork: true`.
- Warning-only is insufficient for a local gateway with file read, logs, config writes, sessions, and PTY exposure.

Concrete tests:

- Config `{ gateway: { host: "0.0.0.0", auth: { enabled: false } } }` refuses start.
- Same host with auth enabled and generated token starts.
- Same host with `insecureAllowUnauthenticatedNetwork: true` starts but logs a prominent warning.
- Loopback hosts `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1` do not require remote-auth friction.

### P0 — File read endpoint must block/redact secrets before returning content

Current `files.ts` comments and implementation allow reading any text file and return `resolvedPath` plus full `content`. This is dangerous when combined with network exposure or compromised local browser.

Required behavior:

- Block high-risk paths by default:
  - `.env`, `.env.*`
  - `~/.ssh/**`
  - `<JINN_HOME>/secrets/**`
  - `<JINN_HOME>/gateway.json` token field, config secrets, connector tokens
  - `~/.claude/**/auth*`, `~/.codex/auth.json`, known CLI auth stores
  - private key/certificate material
- Redact high-risk content patterns even in otherwise allowed project files.
- Do not return `resolvedPath` for denied secret paths if that leaks sensitive local layout; return a clear denial reason/category.
- Overrides, if any, must require local authenticated user and be explicit/auditable.

Concrete tests:

- Normal project file under test home returns content.
- `GET /api/files/read?path=<testHome>/.env` returns 403 or redacted content, never raw secret.
- `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `<JINN_HOME>/secrets/token`, `~/.codex/auth.json`, `~/.claude/.../auth*` are denied/redacted.
- A non-secret file containing `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`, `Authorization: Bearer ...`, private key block, DB URL with credentials returns redacted content.
- Symlink/traversal cases cannot bypass denylist: symlink inside allowed project to `.env`, `../.env`, mixed-case `.ENV`, URL-encoded path.

### P0 — Redaction must be centralized and applied before persistence/output

Current `shared/logger.ts` writes raw messages to stdout and `gateway.log`; `/api/logs` returns raw lines. Config API only redacts fields by key, not arbitrary log/content patterns.

Required behavior:

- Add `shared/redact.ts` and call it in logger before stdout/file writes.
- `/api/logs` must redact again defensively before returning lines.
- Apply redaction to connector outbound messages/alerts and session/cron error surfaces where practical.
- Redactor should cover: bearer/auth headers, common vendor key prefixes, JSON secret fields, env assignments, private key blocks, DB/userinfo URLs, Slack/Discord/Telegram tokens.

Concrete tests:

- `logger.info("Authorization: Bearer sk-...")` writes redacted value.
- `/api/logs` never returns raw token even if a raw historical line exists.
- Cron failure alert and connector outbound formatting redact token-like text.
- Redaction preserves useful context: key names remain, values become `***` or `***REDACTED***`.

### P0 — Test-instance isolation has a hidden live-home read/write path

`shared/paths.ts` hardcodes `INSTANCES_REGISTRY = path.join(os.homedir(), ".jinn", "instances.json")`. `api.ts` `GET /api/instances` calls `loadInstances()`, which reads that file even when `JINN_HOME=<isolated-test-home>`. CLI helpers can also write it via `ensureDefaultInstance/saveInstances`.

This violates the plan's no live `~/.jinn` requirement for isolated verification.

Required behavior:

- In test/security mode, instance registry must be configurable or rooted in the active `JINN_HOME`, or tests must explicitly disable `/api/instances` live-home access.
- At minimum, live verification must assert no reads/writes to the live Jinn home and avoid endpoints that load the live registry until fixed.

Concrete tests:

- With `JINN_HOME=<isolated-test-home>`, `GET /api/instances` must not read the live Jinn registry.
- CLI setup/start in test mode must not create/modify live `~/.jinn/instances.json`.
- Add a test using a sentinel/mocked fs path to prove `INSTANCES_REGISTRY` is isolated.

### P1 — Bootstrap/token UX needs abuse controls

Plan mentions loopback bootstrap but needs stricter details.

Required behavior:

- Token generated under active `JINN_HOME`, ideally `gateway.json`/auth file mode `0600`.
- Bootstrap endpoint only works from loopback, only when no token exists or when authenticated, and never on network-bound interfaces.
- Cookie should be `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict`, path-scoped; `Secure` when HTTPS is used. Avoid exposing token to frontend JS if possible.
- Token comparison must use timing-safe comparison after length check.
- Clear CLI UX: `jinn token` or documented `jq -r .authToken "$JINN_HOME/gateway.json"` without manual copy/paste.

Concrete tests:

- First local bootstrap sets cookie and creates token under test home with `0600` perms.
- Remote-origin/bootstrap attempt is rejected.
- Existing token cannot be overwritten by unauthenticated request.
- Bad cookie does not block valid bearer fallback only if this is intended; precedence must be deterministic.

### P1 — CORS/origin with cookies needs careful validation

Current CORS allows loopback origins and exact Host-match remote origins. Once auth cookies exist, avoid accidental cross-site credential use.

Required behavior/tests:

- If cookies are used, only set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` for allowed origins and never `*`.
- Auth middleware should reject credentialed state-changing requests with untrusted `Origin`/`Sec-Fetch-Site` where browsers provide it.
- Cross-site POST from `evil.example` to `/api/sessions` is rejected even if the browser has a local cookie.

### P1 — Connector/proxy routes need their own trust model

`/api/connectors/:id/incoming` accepts remote-delivered messages. Gateway token auth may break legitimate proxying unless remote instances can authenticate.

Required behavior:

- Protect incoming connector proxy routes with gateway token, per-connector shared secret, or mTLS/Tailscale trust; do not leave public.
- Redact connector outbound/inbound logs and error alerts.
- Provide actionable denial message for misconfigured remote connector.

Concrete tests:

- Unauthenticated connector incoming POST is rejected.
- Authenticated/secret-signed proxy request succeeds.
- Connector message containing a token is redacted before being forwarded to Slack/Discord/Telegram alert channels when appropriate.

### P1 — Hook endpoint should stay loopback + hook-secret scoped

`/api/internal/hook` already appears loopback-oriented via `handleHookPost`/`isLoopback`; ensure general gateway auth middleware does not accidentally open or break it.

Concrete tests:

- Non-loopback hook POST rejected regardless of gateway auth.
- Loopback hook with valid hook secret succeeds.
- Loopback hook with missing/wrong hook secret fails.
- General gateway bearer token alone is not accepted if hook-specific secret is required.

## UX must-fix checks

- Returning local browser should not repeatedly prompt: cookie path/max-age/session handling must be tested.
- CLI/curl should have a one-liner token path under active `JINN_HOME`; avoid making users copy/paste from logs.
- Denied requests should say exactly how to fix: "run locally", "use token from ...", or "enable insecure override".
- Auth must not break static UI loading. Static assets may remain unauthenticated, but API/WS failures should drive a clear login/bootstrap state.
- Normal chat/session creation after auth should remain one click/enter, no per-message prompt.

## Attack/verification checklist for implementer/orchestrator

1. Fresh test home bootstrap:
   - Remove/recreate `<isolated-test-home>`.
   - Start gateway with `JINN_HOME=<isolated-test-home>`, host `127.0.0.1`, port `8000`.
   - Verify token files are only under test home.
2. Unauthenticated attack sweep:
   - `GET /api/status` allowed and minimal.
   - All other `/api/*` privileged routes rejected.
   - `/ws` and `/ws/pty/*` rejected.
3. Authenticated happy path:
   - Bearer token works for curl.
   - Browser cookie works for API + WS.
   - Create session/message still works smoothly.
4. Network exposure:
   - `host: 0.0.0.0` without auth refuses.
   - With auth, remote unauthenticated rejects and authenticated succeeds.
   - Explicit insecure override logs loud warning and is covered by test.
5. File-read protection:
   - Allowed normal file read.
   - Denied/redacted secret files and symlink bypass attempts.
   - Response does not leak unnecessary resolved secret paths.
6. Redaction:
   - Logger, `/api/logs`, config API, connector outbound/alerts, cron/session errors.
7. Isolation:
   - No endpoint/CLI path reads or writes the live Jinn home during verification.
   - Especially fix/prove `/api/instances` and instance registry behavior.
8. Regression tests:
   - Unit tests for helpers/policies.
   - Integration tests for HTTP auth middleware and WS upgrade auth.
   - E2E smoke on port `8000` with test home.

## Notes

- Existing `auth-security.test.ts` is present but untracked and currently references missing `../auth.js`; keep it as TDD red coverage once dependencies are installed, then expand it to include HTTP/WS integration rather than helper-only assertions.
- Existing `file-read.test.ts` encodes arbitrary-read behavior; it must be revised so expected behavior is secrets-deny/redact while preserving normal local project reads.

## Completion pass - implementation + isolated verification

Date: 2026-06-24
Runner: Jimbo/Codex, isolated worktree only
Worktree: `<repo-worktree>`
Test home: `<isolated-test-home>`
Test port: `8000`

### TDD red cycles observed

- `src/cli/__tests__/instances-security.test.ts`: failed because `INSTANCES_REGISTRY` resolved to the live Jinn registry; fixed with an explicit test override while keeping the default registry global.
- `src/gateway/__tests__/files-security.test.ts`: failed for `.envrc` and symlink-to-secret bypass; fixed by blocking `.env*` and assessing canonical real paths.
- `src/shared/__tests__/redact.test.ts`: failed for YAML-style secret fields; fixed by adding multiline key-value redaction without overmatching `Authorization` headers.
- `src/gateway/__tests__/gateway-info.test.ts`: failed for token-only `gateway.json` stale PID handling; fixed with `staleGatewayPids()` filtering.

### Automated verification

- `pnpm --filter jinn-cli test` -> 115 test files passed, 951 tests passed, 1 skipped.
- `pnpm --filter jinn-cli typecheck` -> passed.
- `pnpm build` -> passed. Web build replayed cached output and reported the existing large chunk warning only.

### Isolated live verification

Notes:

- Port `8000` was occupied by another local development service. I temporarily stopped it for the smoke and restored it afterward.
- The gateway was launched with `JINN_HOME=<isolated-test-home>` and Node `24.13.0` because the repo pins Node 24 and the default Homebrew Node 25 cannot load the existing `better-sqlite3` ABI.
- After verification, port `8000` was restored to the prior local service.

Checks:

- `GET /api/status` unauthenticated -> 200, status payload only.
- `GET /api/sessions`, `GET /api/config`, `GET /api/logs` unauthenticated -> 401.
- Bearer token from isolated `gateway.json` -> authenticated `GET /api/sessions` 200.
- `POST /api/auth/bootstrap` from loopback -> 200 and cookie auth; cookie-auth `GET /api/sessions` -> 200.
- `gateway.json` mode -> `0600`.
- Allowed normal file read -> 200.
- `.env` file read -> 403.
- `<JINN_HOME>/secrets/plain.txt` read -> 403.
- Redacted file read -> 200 with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, DB password, and YAML `botToken` values redacted; raw fixture secrets absent from responses.
- Synthetic raw historical log line added under isolated logs; `/api/logs` returned `[REDACTED]` values and did not expose raw tokens.
- `/ws` unauthenticated -> HTTP 401 during upgrade.
- `/ws` with bearer auth -> opened.
- `/ws` with cookie auth -> opened.
- `/ws/pty/fake-session` unauthenticated -> HTTP 401 before session attach.
- `rg` for live Jinn-home paths under the isolated test home -> no matches.
- Final clean boot from fresh test home had no `pid undefined` stale-reap warning.

### Final gates

- [x] Plan reviewed
- [x] TDD red tests observed
- [x] Unit tests passing
- [x] Typecheck passing
- [x] Build passing
- [x] Isolated test instance launched on port 8000
- [x] Authenticated API/browser-cookie path verified

## Review follow-up pass - auth UX + hardening fixes

Date: 2026-06-24
Runner: Jimbo/Codex, isolated worktree only

### Fixes covered

- Kept `POST /api/internal/hook` reachable by the loopback hook relay while preserving the hook-secret check.
- Removed legacy raw-token browser-cookie auth; browser auth now uses revocable device sessions.
- Tightened local bootstrap to require both a loopback socket and loopback `Host` header.
- Added small body limits to public auth routes.
- Recorded gateway `host` in `gateway.json` and shared gateway URL formatting for CLI/internal callers.
- Added bearer-authenticated internal gateway calls for parent wakeups, connector notifications, and Talk delegation.
- Made `jinn pair` / `jinn unpair` work against recorded host values, including IPv6.
- Kept the default multi-instance registry global, with `JINN_INSTANCES_REGISTRY` for isolated tests.
- Stopped remote file transfer from inventing destination filesystem paths; explicit `remotePath` is still supported.
- Added optional remote bearer token support for file transfer.
- Moved `SettingsProvider` inside `AuthGate` so private settings calls do not fire before auth is ready.
- Prevented explicit browser logout/current-device unpair from immediately re-bootstrapping local auth.
- Made post-pair success depend on a fresh authenticated auth-state check.
- Disabled Settings pairing-code creation outside the paired local dashboard.
- Hid row-level Unpair for the current browser and added device kind/IP context.
- Made the pairing screen scrollable and added explicit CLI vs Web Settings flows with mode-specific error recovery.

### Automated verification

- `pnpm --filter jinn-cli test` -> 117 test files passed, 975 tests passed, 1 skipped.
- `pnpm --filter @jinn/web test` -> 56 test files passed, 585 tests passed.
- `pnpm --filter jinn-cli typecheck` -> passed.
- `pnpm --filter @jinn/web typecheck` -> passed.
- `pnpm build` -> passed. Existing web large-chunk warning remains.
- `git diff --check` -> passed.
- Privacy grep over the package diff and plan/verification docs -> no new private-name or local-path leaks.

### Screenshot verification

Captured with a mock gateway on an isolated dev port:

- Unpaired remote/Tailscale browser pairing gate: `/tmp/jinn-auth-pairing-remote.png`
- Settings > Pairing paired-browser management: `/tmp/jinn-auth-settings-pairing-scrolled.png`

Observed:

- Remote browser sees clear CLI and Web Settings pairing choices before private app content.
- Settings > Pairing shows the local current browser, another paired browser, kind/IP metadata, Create pairing code, and no row-level Unpair action for the current browser.

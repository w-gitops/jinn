## What is Jinn?

Jinn is an open-source AI gateway that wraps the Claude Code CLI and Codex SDK
behind a unified daemon process. It routes tasks to AI engines,
manages connectors like Slack, and schedules background work via cron. Jinn is
a bus, not a brain.

## 💡 Why Jinn?

Most AI agent frameworks reinvent the wheel — custom tool-calling loops, brittle context management, hand-rolled retry logic. Then they charge you per API call on top.

**Jinn takes a different approach.** It wraps battle-tested professional CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex) and adds only what they're missing: routing, scheduling, connectors, and an org system.

### 🔑 Works with your Anthropic Max subscription

Because Jinn uses **Claude Code CLI under the hood** — Anthropic's own first-party tool — it works with the [$200/mo Max subscription](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing). No per-token API billing. No surprise $500 invoices. Flat rate, unlimited usage.

Other frameworks can't do this. Anthropic [banned third-party tools from using Max subscription OAuth tokens](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/bedrock-vertex#max-plan) in January 2026. Since Jinn delegates to the official CLI, it's fully supported.

And starting **June 15, 2026**, Anthropic stops subsidizing `claude -p` (headless one-shot mode) under the Max subscription — only the interactive TUI keeps billing as `cc_entrypoint=cli`. Most wrappers will silently start hitting your API credit pool. Jinn has already moved every Claude turn off `-p` and onto the real interactive TUI driven inside a PTY — see [How the Claude engine works](#-how-the-claude-engine-works-under-the-hood) below. Your subscription keeps working.

### 🧞 Jinn vs OpenClaw

| | Jinn | OpenClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Wraps professional CLIs (Claude Code, Codex) | Custom agentic loop |
| **Max subscription** | ✅ Works (uses official Claude Code CLI) | ❌ Banned since Jan 2026 |
| **Typical cost** | $200/mo flat (Max) or pay-per-use | $300–750/mo API bills ([reported by users](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenClaw/)) |
| **Security** | Inherits Claude Code's security model | 512 vulnerabilities found by CrowdStrike |
| **Memory & context** | Handled natively by Claude Code | Custom implementation with [known context-drop bugs](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/5429) |
| **Cron scheduling** | ✅ Built-in, hot-reloadable | ❌ [Fires in wrong agent context](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/16053) |
| **Slack integration** | ✅ Thread-aware, reaction workflow | ❌ [Drops agent-to-agent messages](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/15836) |
| **Multi-agent org** | Departments, ranks, managers, boards | Flat agent list |
| **Self-modification** | Agents can edit their own config at runtime | Limited |

### 🧠 The "bus, not brain" philosophy

Jinn adds **zero custom AI logic**. No prompt engineering layer. No opinions on how agents should think. All intelligence comes from the engines themselves — Claude Code already handles tool use, file editing, multi-step reasoning, and memory. Jinn just connects it to the outside world.

When Claude Code gets better, Jinn gets better — automatically.

```

The CLI sends commands to the gateway daemon. The daemon dispatches work to AI
engines (Claude Code, Codex), manages connector integrations, runs
scheduled cron jobs, and serves the web dashboard.

## 🪄 How the Claude engine works under the hood

Anthropic stops subsidizing `claude -p` under the Max subscription on **June 15, 2026** — only the interactive TUI keeps billing as `cc_entrypoint=cli`. So Jinn drives the real interactive `claude` binary, not the headless one-shot mode.

Every Claude turn — cron jobs, Slack messages, the web Chat view, the web CLI view — flows through the same path:

- **Real TUI under PTY.** The interactive `claude` binary runs inside a [node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty) pseudo-terminal, byte-for-byte identical to typing `claude` at your shell. Anthropic's billing pipeline sees `cc_entrypoint=cli` and counts it against your Max subscription.
- **Hooks for turn boundaries.** Jinn writes a per-session `--settings` file that registers Claude Code's own `SessionStart` / `Stop` / `StopFailure` / `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` hooks. A tiny `hook-relay.mjs` script POSTs each hook event back to the daemon over loopback with a shared secret, so the daemon knows exactly when a turn starts, finishes, or hits a rate limit — no screen-scraping required.
- **Transcript tail for streaming.** Mid-turn output is streamed by tailing Claude Code's own JSONL transcript at `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/<sessionId>.jsonl` with a long-lived file handle. Same data Claude Code uses internally, no ANSI parsing.
- **Per-session PTY reuse.** A `KEEP ALIVE` toggle per session decides whether the PTY survives across turns (snappy follow-ups, warm context) or is reaped after a configurable grace window (lower memory). Orphan PTYs are killed on daemon restart and on session delete.
- **Same engine powers both UI views.** The web UI's Chat ↔ CLI toggle is just two views of the same PTY: Chat renders the parsed delta stream, CLI attaches `xterm.js` directly to the live terminal. One process, one billing event.
- **Cost reconstruction.** At turn end the daemon sums token usage straight from the transcript JSONL — no need to parse cost from TUI output.
- **Rate-limit handling.** A `StopFailure` hook carrying a rate-limit reason flips the session into the shared wait/retry loop used by every engine.

**Codex** keeps the simple spawn-per-turn model (`spawn(bin, args)` per request). It doesn't have Claude's subscription-billing wrinkle, so it doesn't need a PTY.

If you want to opt out and use the old headless mode, set `engines.claude.mode: headless` in `~/.jinn/config.yaml` — Jinn will fall back to `claude -p` for that engine.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Jinn reads its configuration from `~/.jinn/config.yaml`. An example:

```yaml
gateway:
  port: 7777

engines:
  claude:
    enabled: true
  codex:
    enabled: false

connectors:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    app_token: xapp-...
    bot_token: xoxb-...

cron:
  jobs:
    - name: daily-review
      schedule: "0 9 * * *"
      task: "Review open PRs"

org:
  agents:
    - name: reviewer
      role: code-review
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
jinn/
  packages/
    jimmy/          # Core gateway daemon + CLI
    web/            # Web dashboard (frontend)
  turbo.json        # Turborepo build configuration
  pnpm-workspace.yaml
  tsconfig.base.json
```

## 🧑‍💻 Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hristo2612/jinn.git
cd jinn
pnpm install
pnpm setup   # one-time: builds all packages and creates ~/.jinn
pnpm dev     # starts gateway + Next.js dev server with hot reload
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the web dashboard.

`pnpm dev` starts two servers behind the scenes: the **gateway daemon** on
`:7777` (API, WebSocket, connectors) and the **Next.js dev server** on `:3000`
(web dashboard with hot reload). Next.js rewrites proxy `/api/*` and `/ws`
requests from `:3000` to the gateway, so you only need to visit `:3000`. The
gateway auto-restarts when you edit backend source files via Node's built-in
`--watch` mode. To use a non-default gateway port, set `GATEWAY_PORT=<port>`
before running `pnpm dev`.

> **Prerequisites:** Node.js 22+, pnpm 10+, and the
> [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`).

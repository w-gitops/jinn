## What is Jinn?

Jinn is an open-source AI gateway that wraps professional AI coding CLIs (Claude
Code, Codex, and Antigravity) behind a unified daemon process. It routes tasks to
AI engines, manages connectors like Slack, and schedules background work via
cron. Jinn is a bus, not a brain.

## 💡 Why Jinn?

Most AI agent frameworks reinvent the wheel: custom tool-calling loops, brittle
context management, hand-rolled retry logic. Then they charge you per API call on
top.

**Jinn takes a different approach.** It wraps battle-tested professional CLI tools
(Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity) and adds only what they're missing: routing,
scheduling, connectors, and an org system.

### 🔑 Works with your Anthropic Max subscription

Because Jinn uses **Claude Code CLI under the hood** (Anthropic's own first-party
tool) it works with the [$200/mo Max subscription](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing).
No per-token API billing. No surprise $500 invoices. Flat rate, unlimited usage.

Other frameworks can't do this. Anthropic [banned third-party tools from using Max subscription OAuth tokens](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/bedrock-vertex#max-plan)
in January 2026. Since Jinn delegates to the official CLI, it's fully supported.

And starting **June 15, 2026**, Anthropic stops subsidizing `claude -p` (headless
one-shot mode) under the Max subscription: only the interactive TUI keeps billing
as `cc_entrypoint=cli`. Most wrappers will silently start hitting your API credit
pool. Jinn has already moved every Claude turn off `-p` and onto the real
interactive TUI driven inside a PTY (see [How the Claude engine works](#-how-the-claude-engine-works-under-the-hood)
below). Your subscription keeps working.

### 🧞 Jinn vs OpenClaw

| | Jinn | OpenClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Wraps professional CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity) | Custom agentic loop |
| **Max subscription** | ✅ Works (uses official Claude Code CLI) | ❌ Banned since Jan 2026 |
| **Typical cost** | $200/mo flat (Max) or pay-per-use | $300–750/mo API bills ([reported by users](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenClaw/)) |
| **Security** | Inherits Claude Code's security model | 512 vulnerabilities found by CrowdStrike |
| **Memory & context** | Handled natively by Claude Code | Custom implementation with [known context-drop bugs](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/5429) |
| **Cron scheduling** | ✅ Built-in, hot-reloadable | ❌ [Fires in wrong agent context](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/16053) |
| **Slack integration** | ✅ Thread-aware, reaction workflow | ❌ [Drops agent-to-agent messages](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/15836) |
| **Multi-agent org** | Departments, ranks, managers, boards | Flat agent list |
| **Self-modification** | Agents can edit their own config at runtime | Limited |

### 🧠 The "bus, not brain" philosophy

Jinn adds **zero custom AI logic**. No prompt engineering layer. No opinions on how
agents should think. All intelligence comes from the engines themselves: Claude
Code already handles tool use, file editing, multi-step reasoning, and memory. Jinn
just connects it to the outside world.

When Claude Code gets better, Jinn gets better, automatically.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** Node.js 22+ and at least one engine CLI on your `PATH` — Jinn
> orchestrates them and can't run a session without one:
> - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code): `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
> - [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) (optional): `npm install -g @openai/codex`

```bash
npm install -g jinn-cli
jinn setup
jinn start
```

Or install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap hristo2612/jinn https://github.com/hristo2612/jinn
brew install jinn
jinn setup
jinn start
```

Then open [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777).

> **Authenticate your engines first.** Jinn drives the official engine CLIs, so
> sign in to them once before `jinn start`: run `claude` and use `/login`, and
> run `codex` to sign in. (Antigravity, if you use it, signs in the same way via
> its own CLI.) Without this, sessions can't reach the models.

Everyday commands:

```bash
jinn start      # start the gateway daemon
jinn stop       # stop the gateway daemon
jinn restart    # restart safely (detached; works even from inside a session)
jinn status     # check whether the daemon is running
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```

The CLI sends commands to the gateway daemon. The daemon dispatches work to AI
engines (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity), manages connector integrations, runs
scheduled cron jobs, and serves the web dashboard.

## 🪄 How the Claude engine works under the hood

Anthropic stops subsidizing `claude -p` under the Max subscription on **June 15,
2026**: only the interactive TUI keeps billing as `cc_entrypoint=cli`. So Jinn
drives the real interactive `claude` binary, not the headless one-shot mode.

Every Claude turn (cron jobs, Slack messages, the web Chat view, the web CLI view)
flows through the same path:

- **Real TUI under PTY.** The interactive `claude` binary runs inside a [node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty)
  pseudo-terminal, byte-for-byte identical to typing `claude` at your shell.
  Anthropic's billing pipeline sees `cc_entrypoint=cli` and counts it against your
  Max subscription.
- **Hooks for turn boundaries.** Jinn writes a per-session `--settings` file that
  registers Claude Code's own `SessionStart` / `Stop` / `StopFailure` /
  `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` hooks. A tiny `hook-relay.mjs` script POSTs each hook
  event back to the daemon over loopback with a shared secret, so the daemon knows
  exactly when a turn starts, finishes, or hits a rate limit. No screen-scraping
  required.
- **SSE-intercept streaming.** The PTY's `claude` is pointed at a per-session
  loopback proxy via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. Jinn intercepts the model's own
  server-sent-event stream and forwards it to the web UI word-by-word (with ordered
  intermediate text), so there's no ANSI parsing of the terminal.
- **Per-session PTY reuse.** A `KEEP ALIVE` toggle per session decides whether the
  PTY survives across turns (snappy follow-ups, warm context) or is reaped after a
  configurable grace window (lower memory). Orphan PTYs are killed on daemon restart
  and on session delete.
- **Same engine powers both UI views.** The web UI's Chat ↔ CLI toggle is just two
  views of the same PTY: Chat renders the parsed delta stream, CLI attaches
  `xterm.js` directly to the live terminal. One process, one billing event.
- **Cost reconstruction.** At turn end the daemon sums token usage straight from
  Claude Code's own transcript JSONL at
  `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/<sessionId>.jsonl`, with no need to parse cost from TUI
  output.
- **Rate-limit handling.** A `StopFailure` hook carrying a rate-limit reason flips
  the session into the shared wait/retry loop used by every engine.

**Codex** and **Antigravity** keep the simple spawn-per-turn model (`spawn(bin,
args)` per request). They don't have Claude's subscription-billing wrinkle, so they
don't need a PTY.

## 🔌 Engines

Jinn supports multiple engines. Switch per session or per employee in the web UI — only engines whose CLI is installed on your `PATH` are available.

| Engine | What it is | Install | Modes | Effort |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| **claude** | Anthropic Claude Code CLI — first-party, Max-subscription-friendly | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | Chat (PTY + SSE) · CLI (xterm) | low / medium / high |
| **codex** | OpenAI Codex CLI | `npm install -g @openai/codex` | Chat (headless) · CLI (xterm) | low / medium / high / xhigh |
| **grok** | xAI Grok CLI | `npm install -g @xai-official/grok` (then run `grok` once to authenticate) | Chat (headless) · CLI (xterm) | low / medium / high / xhigh / max |
| **antigravity** | Antigravity CLI | (see Antigravity docs) | CLI (xterm) | — |
| **pi** | Pi coding agent CLI | (see Pi CLI docs) | Chat (headless) | — |
| **hermes** | NousResearch Hermes — open-source, model-agnostic, self-improving agent | `curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh \| bash` | Chat (ACP streaming) · CLI (xterm view) | — |

> **Hermes cost note.** Unlike the subscription-wrapped engines above, Hermes owns its own model loop and bills **per token** on the provider configured in `~/.hermes` (e.g. OpenAI Codex). Costs accrue at your provider — not as part of a Jinn subscription. See [`docs/engines-hermes.md`](docs/engines-hermes.md) for full details.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Jinn reads its configuration from `~/.jinn/config.yaml`. An example:

```yaml
gateway:
  port: 7777
  host: "127.0.0.1"

engines:
  default: claude        # claude | codex | antigravity
  claude:
    bin: claude          # binary on your PATH
    model: opus
    effortLevel: medium
  codex:
    bin: codex
    model: gpt-5.4
    effortLevel: high

connectors:
  slack:
    shareSessionInChannel: false
    ignoreOldMessagesOnBoot: true
```

Each engine points at a CLI binary (`bin`) and a default `model`; the
`engines.default` key selects which one new sessions use. Cron jobs are defined
separately in `~/.jinn/cron/jobs.json` (hot-reloaded on change), not inline in
`config.yaml`.

The AI org (employees) lives as individual YAML files in `~/.jinn/org/`, one per
employee, each defining its persona, rank, department, and engine. The daemon
rebuilds the org registry whenever those files change.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
jinn/
  packages/
    jinn/           # Core gateway daemon + CLI
    web/            # Web dashboard (Vite + React)
  turbo.json        # Turborepo build configuration
  pnpm-workspace.yaml
  tsconfig.base.json
```

## 🧑‍💻 Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hristo2612/jinn.git
cd jinn
pnpm install
pnpm setup   # one-time: builds all packages and creates ~/.jinn
pnpm dev     # starts the gateway + Vite dev server with hot reload
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to use the web dashboard.

`pnpm dev` (via Turborepo) starts two servers: the **gateway daemon** on `:7777`
(API, WebSocket, connectors) and the **Vite dev server** on `:5173` (web dashboard
with hot reload). Vite proxies `/api/*` and `/ws` from `:5173` to the gateway, so
you only need to visit `:5173`. The gateway auto-restarts when you edit backend
source via Node's built-in `--watch` mode. To point the dev UI at a non-default
gateway port, set `GATEWAY_PORT=<port>` before running `pnpm dev`.

> **Prerequisites:** Node.js 22+, pnpm 10+, and the
> [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`).

# Changelog

## [0.21.3] - 2026-06-22

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Existing operators no longer get the onboarding prompt re-injected.** Configs that completed the setup wizard (`portal.onboarded`) are now treated as setup-complete, so the gateway stops emitting the onboarding directive and the setup-status API reports `setupComplete`/`conversationNeeded` correctly for legacy installs.

## [0.21.2] - 2026-06-22

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Connector-backed replies no longer hang after Homebrew/npm installs.** The npm publish manifest now includes `assets/hook-relay.mjs`, so gateway boot can restore `~/.jinn/hook-relay.mjs` and Claude Stop hooks can report completed Slack/Discord/Telegram turns.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-11

> Talk becomes a real delegation workspace: searchable session memory, server-owned delegation graphs, persistent conversation flow, and live work rails. The gateway also gets a stability pass for interactive engines, stuck-session recovery, restart safety, and context telemetry.

### ✨ Features
- **Talk delegation workspace.** Server-owned `POST /api/talk/delegate`, live `TalkGraph` snapshots/deltas, persisted prompt excerpts, attach/detach controls, session search, inline cards, and a WorkDock/work-tree that can follow nested employee sessions at any depth.
- **Conversation-first Talk UI.** Persistent transcript, pinned decision cards, focused stage modes, thread drawer breadcrumbs, real delegation hierarchy, live activity lines, completion excerpts, and a calmer orb/stage layout that keeps the conversation visible while work happens.
- **Talk voice flow upgrades.** Per-sentence TTS streaming removes whole-turn dead air, speech is sanitized server-side for URLs/UUIDs/machine tags, and the orchestrator persona now favors delegation-first behavior with search and attachment awareness.
- **Message search.** Sessions now have FTS5 full-text search over messages with chunked backfill and a fail-safe degrade path so search failures never take down the gateway.

### ⚡ Performance / Reliability
- **Interactive engine stability.** Shared PTY stream/tailer infrastructure, bounded stream maps, StopFailure grace windows, late-Stop recovery, Codex terminal-marker gating, and retry-aware SSE activity tracking reduce false failed turns and leaked process state.
- **Gateway resilience.** Status reconciliation unsticks stale `running` sessions, restart keeps the PID file until the process actually exits, config/job writes are atomic, cron reads are tail-based, connector stop intervals are cleaned up, and queue/session deletes purge related work items.
- **Context hygiene.** Employee prompts now use audience-scoped context, compact org rosters, deduped API references, cleaner chain-of-command slugs, and less repeated template text.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Chat session state and context telemetry.** Background-agent indicators now reflect live engine activity, external CLI turns sync into the web session, the SSE idle window is 60 minutes, and Codex context meters use current-turn token telemetry instead of cumulative totals.
- **Claude onboarding hangs.** Trust seeding now also marks Claude Code's global onboarding and Claude-in-Chrome onboarding complete, preventing first-run interactive prompts from blocking gateway-launched Claude sessions.
- **Talk correctness.** Delegation cards survive reload, thread cards honor session renames and status vocabulary, stale notifications are preserved on rehydrate, label-based wake messages avoid leaking session ids, and card/thread accessibility edge cases were tightened.
- **Session/search safety.** FTS backfill failures disable search for the process instead of blocking boot; rate-limit retries preserve transport metadata; media messages survive reconcile age caps; and loopback checks/config writes are normalized.

### 🪄 Docs
- Added Talk redesign specs, implementation plans, and post-review notes for the delegation graph, stage layout, and conversation-first UI work.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-09

> Talk grows up: a calmer voice-first surface, a configurable orchestrator engine with seamless fallback (so Talk works on Codex/Antigravity, not just Claude), in-app mic setup, type-to-talk, and a silent/read mode. Plus a fresh-install hardening pass, org-map improvements, and a repository privacy scrub.

### ✨ Features
- **Talk — quieter, more usable voice surface.** The screen was reworked so the AURA orb dominates: collapsed/icon-only thread panel, one-word status, focused-only channel labels, a throttled level meter, and a Stop-speaking button. The orchestrator persona was rewritten ~50% leaner and voice-first.
- **Talk — configurable orchestrator engine + seamless fallback.** The voice orchestrator is no longer hardcoded to Claude. New `config.talk.engine` plus a resolver chain (`talk.engine → default engine → first available`) means a user with only **Codex** or only **Antigravity** gets a working Talk out of the box. A tucked-away gear picker switches engine + model live (applies next turn).
- **Talk — type-to-talk.** A keyboard toggle reveals a text input that routes through the same path as a voice turn — usable when you can't speak or the mic isn't set up. The main button is action-aware, morphing **Mic ↔ Send ↔ Stop**.
- **Talk — mute / silent-read mode.** Suppresses speech (both neural and browser fallback) and skips server-side synthesis entirely when muted; replies are read in the transcript. Persisted across reloads.
- **Talk — in-app mic setup.** Tapping the mic on a fresh install now opens the shared Whisper-model download flow (reused from chat) instead of dead-ending; `jinn setup` checks for `whisper-cli` + `ffmpeg` and prints install guidance.
- **Talk — focused card model.** The voice surface now shows only actionable/watchable cards (approval, choice, status, agent-activity, plus a rare text valve); richer card types are reserved for chat.
- **Org map.** Map-only `/org` view with a compact d3-hierarchy layout, an inline employee editor in the detail panel, a full employee-update API (`PATCH /api/org/employees/:name`), and chat deep-links to contactable roster employees.

### ⚡ Performance / Reliability
- **Kokoro neural TTS hardening.** The voice sidecar now recovers automatically if its Python venv is invalidated by a base-Python upgrade (a broken interpreter symlink is treated as "rebuild needed"), so neural voice doesn't silently degrade to the robotic browser fallback.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Duplicate works for `.jinn` sessions** — the fork slug now handles `.` in the working-directory path.
- **Fresh-install hardening** — a missing/unauthenticated engine is surfaced clearly instead of failing silently; engine binary resolution is unified across Claude/Codex (thin-PATH safe); the onboarding rename is fixed; config reload is instant; the browser opens on first start; the seeded config now includes the MCP block.
- **Connector reply delivery** when a web-session turn completes; **Codex fallback** guarded on the engine actually being installed; **mid-turn stream blocks** persist so a refresh restores them; child turn text is recovered from the transcript when the Stop hook is lost.

### 🔒 Privacy
- **Repository privacy scrub.** Removed maintainer/third-party personal data that had been committed into shipped source (notably the default Talk persona), genericized examples, and **stopped shipping test files in the npm tarball**. The default persona and templates are now fully generic; anything personal lives only in a user's local `~/.jinn`.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-06-08

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Chat alignment.** The in-progress **"Thinking" indicator** now shares the same gutter as message text and tool cards (it was inset ~16px to the left). Completes the tool-card alignment from 0.18.0.
- **Mobile composer strip.** The Engine · Model · Effort · context selector row no longer wraps on phones (a grid spacer was stealing half the row, pushing "Opus 4.8" onto two lines). It's now mobile-first single-line with non-wrapping pills that scroll if needed, and the "· applies next message" hint is hidden on mobile (kept on desktop).

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-04

> Big release: the voice-first **Talk** interface, the **Antigravity** engine (replacing Gemini CLI), a dynamic model registry with mid-chat switching, a race-free `jinn restart`, the **Ledger** web theme, and WebSocket reliability work.

### ✨ Features
- **Talk - voice-first COO interface at `/talk`.** A hands-on voice layer over the COO: the AURA avatar (state-reactive orb with channel-morphing), client-side Web Speech TTS with per-sentence playback and a sentence-synced transcript, and **decision-support cards** pushed over a dedicated card-action channel. A **thread panel** lets you see, switch, label, and dismiss child sessions by voice, and open any child session in a chat modal (from a thread chip or satellite orb). Voice state persists across route-switch, reload, and backgrounding; persona hot-reloads; iOS Web Speech is unlocked on first gesture.
- **Antigravity (`agy`) engine** - Google Antigravity replaces the removed Gemini slot as a PTY-interactive engine. agy has no headless/`--print` mode and no hook system, so turns are driven through a PTY (one instance both runs turns and backs the xterm view) and completion is detected by tailing agy's per-conversation transcript (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<convId>/.system_generated/logs/transcript.jsonl`) for a `MODEL/PLANNER_RESPONSE/status:DONE` line. The conversation id becomes the engine session id; resume uses `agy --conversation <id>`. The binary is resolved **dynamically** (PATH + common dirs incl. `~/.local/bin`, optional `engines.antigravity.bin` override) - no hardcoded paths. Workspace trust is pre-seeded by realpath before spawn so the interactive trust gate never blocks; the cached Google credential is reused (no re-auth). Default model Gemini 3 Flash (agy ignores model flags today; `/model` injection deferred). Verified end-to-end against agy v1.0.x (May 2026).
- **Dynamic model + capability registry** - `models:` block in `config.yaml` (per-model `{id,label,supportsEffort,effortLevels}`, per-engine `effortMechanism`) is the single source of truth for which engines/models exist and what they support. New `GET /api/engines` exposes the resolved registry. When the block is absent it's **synthesized** from `engines.<name>.model`, so existing configs keep working. **Adding a new model is a config edit - zero code change.** Cache invalidates on config reload and `PUT /api/config`.
- **Mid-chat model & effort switching** - `PUT|PATCH /api/sessions/:id` accepts `{ model?, effortLevel? }`, validated against the registry for the session's engine, and applies **from the next turn** (in place - a resume spike confirmed `claude -p --resume --model <new>` honors the new model while preserving history, so no fork is needed). Engine is **new-chat-only** (not mutable mid-chat). Antigravity model changes persist but are a logged runtime no-op (agy ignores model flags).
- **Web composer selector row** - a compact **Engine · Model · Effort** pill row above the chat input, fully registry-driven (no hardcoded lists). Engine is editable on a new chat / read-only chip in an existing chat; Model + Effort editable in both; Effort is filtered to the model's levels and hidden for effort-less engines (antigravity). Pre-fills from the chosen employee's config (new chat) or the loaded session; in-chat changes PATCH the session with an "applies to next message" note. Settings-page model/effort dropdowns are now registry-driven too (kills stale `opus-4-6` labels).
- **`jinn restart` - detached, in-session-safe restart.** A new command that performs stop -> wait-for-port-free -> start from a reparented helper process, so it survives the gateway killing its own session PTYs (the reason a naive `stop && start` from inside a session used to leave the gateway down). `jinn start` now also auto-restarts cleanly when a gateway is already running, instead of racing the old one's shutdown into `EADDRINUSE`.
- **Ledger web theme** - the dashboard's production look: a Dock x Ledger layout in light and dark, fully tokenized colors, and a full-width document-style chat transcript.

### ⚡ Performance / Reliability
- **WebSocket resilience.** Gateway ping/pong heartbeat reaps half-open sockets; the web client reconnects with backoff plus a watchdog and resume listeners; the CLI terminal reconnects without disposing xterm; chat backfills on active turns; and loaded session pages are preserved across refetches.

### 🐛 Fixes / Changed
- **Interrupted sessions resume cleanly on reconnect.** After a gateway restart the web chat now reloads the interrupted session on WS reconnect and clears the stuck loading spinner, so the conversation is immediately usable instead of frozen until the next message.
- **Effort validation is registry-driven** - replaced the hardcoded `VALID_EFFORTS` set with per-engine+model `effortLevels` from the registry. This fixes the silent **`xhigh` rejection** for codex (now valid and passed through). Unknown/unsupported levels are dropped with a logged warning (graceful degradation), never a silent pass or a throw; effort-less engines default cleanly with no noise.
- **Talk polish** - the chat modal no longer hangs on a load failure; dismissed threads stay dismissed; `stripMarkdown` no longer mangles spoken code/math/URLs; the card validator fails closed on nested fields and is wrapped in an error boundary.
- **Streaming + proxy** - restored live streaming and persona injection via `--append-system-prompt`; the proxy retries corrupted-TLS-socket errors (bad record mac / decrypt error / EPROTO).
- **Tool cards** align their left edge with the message text column.

### 💥 Removed / Not supported
- **Removed the Gemini CLI engine.** Google is sunsetting Gemini CLI for individual/free and AI Pro/Ultra users on **2026-06-18**, directing them to Antigravity. The `gemini` engine option (`engines.gemini`, `engine: gemini`) is gone. **Gemini *API* usage is unaffected** - `GEMINI_API_KEY` features (deep-research, nano-banana) still work. Historical migration notes left intact.
- **Fast mode is explicitly NOT supported** (any engine). The real `claude` CLI has no `--fast` flag - `/fast` is an interactive, stateful TUI toggle (resets on model switch, org-disablable) with no headless/flag equivalent, and Jinn runs turns headless. Rather than carry dead infra, the concept was dropped end-to-end (no `supportsFast` in the registry, no UI control).

### 🪄 Docs
- README overhaul: Antigravity replaces Gemini throughout, the web stack is corrected to Vite (`:5173`), new features are documented (file attachments, in-app file viewer, per-session engine/model/effort, live context meter, `jinn restart`), and the obsolete `engines.claude.mode` headless opt-out was removed. Em dashes purged across all Markdown (except version-pinned migration records).

## [0.17.1] - 2026-05-31

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Slack reaction approvals work again on older messages.** The `reaction_added` handler gated on the *reacted-to message's* age via `ignoreOldMessagesOnBoot`, so any reaction on a message posted before the gateway's last boot was silently dropped. This broke human-in-the-loop approval flows where a card waits hours for a ✅ (and every gateway restart made all pending cards un-reactable). The boot-replay guard now checks the **reaction event's own `event_ts`**, so a fresh reaction on an old message is always honored while genuinely replayed-on-boot reactions are still skipped.
- **Instant `:eyes:` ack on reactions.** The connector now adds an `:eyes:` reaction the moment it accepts a user reaction, giving immediate visual confirmation the gateway heard it.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-31

### ✨ Features
- **Clickable file paths → in-app file viewer.** File paths mentioned in chat messages (e.g. `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-31-platform-support-design.md`) are now auto-detected and rendered as links - including the common case where agents wrap them in backticks. Clicking opens the file as a new **in-app tab** (the same VS Code-style tab bar as chats, labelled with the basename), rendering markdown via `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` and code with Prism syntax highlighting. Lets you read any referenced artifact without leaving the dashboard - ideal over Tailscale where the file isn't directly reachable.
- **Standalone `/file?path=` route** - the same viewer as a full page, for opening files in a real browser tab (a subtle ⧉ button inside the in-app viewer pops it out) and for direct/remote access.
- **File-read endpoint** `GET /api/files/read?path=` - reads any file on disk (single-user/Tailscale threat model, no allowlist) with a 5 MB size cap and binary detection. Relative paths resolve `~/.jinn` first, then `~/Projects`, then gateway cwd, then literal; absolute/`~` paths used verbatim.
- **Mobile back button** in the embedded viewer that returns to the chat the link was opened from; sticky frosted control chips (back + pop-out) that stay reachable while scrolling.

### 🐛 Fixes
- File-viewer content wraps to the available width - no more horizontal scrollbar on long code lines or unbroken tokens (prose wraps, code blocks contain their own overflow).

## [0.16.1] - 2026-05-30

### 🐛 Fixes
- **User messages with attachments no longer render twice.** The v0.16.0 outbound-vanishing fix deduped reconciled history by message id only. A sent user message is appended optimistically with a client-side random id while the server persists it under a different canonical id, so on the next history refresh the optimistic copy was kept *alongside* the server copy - duplicating the whole message (text + every image/video). `reconcileMessages` now also matches on a content-identity key (role + content + media filenames, media-type-agnostic so videos work), collapsing the optimistic message into its server twin while still preserving genuinely-live agent attachments missing from a racing snapshot.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-05-30

### ✨ Features
- **File & image attachments in the web chat, both directions.** Attach any file type (images, PDFs, zip, docs, anything) from the composer via drag-drop, click, or paste - the bytes are stored locally under `~/.jinn/uploads/YYYY-MM-DD/<sessionId>/` and **only the file path** is injected into the engine prompt, so Claude/Codex/Gemini read it with their own tools instead of being fed raw bytes. First-message uploads are re-homed into the session bucket once it's created (no orphans).
- **Outbound attachments API** - a running session can push files/images back **into** the chat via `POST /api/sessions/:id/attachments` (accepts `multipart`, or JSON `{path|content|url}`), exactly like agents already curl `POST /api/sessions` to spawn children. Renders in the web chat view (documented limitation: the raw CLI/xterm stream can't render inline). Messages now persist a `media` column.
- **Rich file UX** - images render as inline thumbnails that open a full-screen lightbox (Esc/click to close, with download); non-image files render as download chips with name + size; multiple files in one message are handled without clobbering. Image loading uses a skeleton shimmer that cross-fades to the image (no layout shift) with a graceful broken-image fallback.

### ⚡ Performance
- **Immutable browser caching for file responses** - `GET /api/files/:id` now sends `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` plus a strong `ETag` and `Last-Modified`, and answers conditional `If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since` requests with `304 Not Modified`. Re-opening a chat no longer re-downloads every image - a big win on slow connections.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Pushed attachments no longer vanish from the chat** - the `session:completed` handler was popping the last assistant bubble (to swap the optimistic streaming text), which also ate a freshly-pushed attachment message until a page reload. It now never pops a message carrying `media`, uses the server's canonical message id, and merges (rather than replaces) on history refresh so the attachment shows exactly once.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-05-22

### 🐛 Fixes
- **`jinn --version` reported the wrong version** - the CLI reads its version from `dist/package.json` (emitted by tsc from the `import pkg from "../package.json"` in `bin/jinn.ts`). v0.15.0 was published with a stale `dist/` built before the version bump, so it reported `0.14.0` and the Homebrew formula's `--version` test would mismatch. Rebuilt after the bump; `dist/package.json` and `jinn --version` now match the package version.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-22

### ♻️ Refactor
- **Kill the legacy naming soup** - the repo, home dir, npm package, and binary all converged on **jinn**, but the project folder (`~/Projects/<legacy-name>`) and the inner package (`packages/<legacy-name>`) were the lone holdouts. Renamed the project root to `~/Projects/jinn`, `packages/<legacy-name>` → `packages/jinn`, and the CLI entry `bin/<legacy-name>.ts` → `bin/jinn.ts`. The published npm package (`jinn-cli`), the `jinn` binary, and the `~/.jinn` workspace are unchanged - no action needed for existing installs. All workspace/build/Formula/workflow/release-skill path references updated to match.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-21

### ✨ Features
- **Telegram voice/audio transcription** (#59) - `voice`, `audio`, and `video_note` messages are transcribed through the bundled `stt/stt.ts` (whisper.cpp) before reaching the engine, fixing the empty-`text` session-resume crash. Multi-language config → `auto`; concurrent voice notes are serialized to avoid OOM on small hosts, with a one-line "queued" ack. If STT is unavailable/empty, the message is dropped with a user-facing explanation instead of forwarding empty text.
- **Telegram file attachments** (#60) - documents, photos, videos, animations, and stickers are downloaded and surfaced via `msg.attachments` (UUID-named in `TMP_DIR` to avoid collisions), so the engine actually receives files instead of silently dropping them. `video_note` is routed to transcription (above), not attached, to avoid double-handling.

## [0.13.3] - 2026-05-20

### ✨ Features
- **Child-reply notification banner is back in the web UI** - when an employee (child) session replies, the parent session's chat shows a centered system banner again (live via the `session:notification` WS event, and on history reload). It was removed by the v0.13.0 "nuke notifications" cleanup along with the bell.

### 🪄 Polish
- **Dual-audience callback messages** - the child-reply notification is now decoupled: the parent **engine** (e.g. the COO) receives a full-context message with the child session id and API pointers to follow up, while the **web UI** shows a clean, simplified banner (`📩 <employee> replied` + a tidy preview) instead of the old noisy `GET /api/sessions/…?last=N` / `Preview:` blob. The gateway persists + emits the clean version for display and runs the engine on the full one.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-05-20

### 🪄 Docs
- **Align delegation guidance with restored callbacks** - the `template/CLAUDE.md`, `template/AGENTS.md`, and the runtime-injected delegation protocol (`context.ts`) disagreed about whether the gateway notifies a parent session: the templates still said "auto-notify, never poll" while `context.ts` (post-nuke) said "no callback, poll." Now that v0.13.1 restored the callback, all three describe the same **hybrid** model: the gateway wakes you on a child reply, with polling as a fallback so a missed callback never leaves a parent idle.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-05-20

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Restore parent-session callbacks** - the "nuke notifications" cleanup (v0.13.0) was meant to remove only the web notification bell, but it also stripped the backend mechanism that wakes a parent session when a child session replies. Child/employee sessions were finishing without ever notifying their parent/COO session, so delegated work returned silently and had to be polled for manually. Restores `notifyParentSession` and the `role:"notification"` message path (including the "don't interrupt a running parent turn" guard), `Employee.alwaysNotify`, `JinnConfig.notifications`, and the `PATCH /api/org/employees/:name` endpoint. The web bell UI stays removed.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-18

### ✨ Features
- **Interactive Claude engine** - every Claude turn (cron, connectors, web Chat, web CLI) now runs the real interactive `claude` TUI inside a node-pty pseudo-terminal. Bills as `cc_entrypoint=cli`, preserving Max subscription past Anthropic's June 15, 2026 cutoff that ends `claude -p` subsidy.
- **Hook-driven turn boundaries** - per-session `--settings` file registers Claude Code's SessionStart/Stop/StopFailure/PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks; a tiny `hook-relay.mjs` POSTs each event back to the daemon over loopback so turn lifecycle is detected without screen-scraping.
- **Per-session KEEP ALIVE control** - toggle in web UI decides whether a PTY survives across turns (snappy follow-ups, warm context) or is reaped after the grace window. Orphan PTYs reaped on daemon restart.
- **Web Chat ↔ CLI toggle per session** - `xterm.js` view of the live PTY (CLI mode) or parsed delta stream (Chat mode), persisted per session. One process, one billing event for either view.
- **Recently-viewed chat keep-alive cache** - chats stay mounted in the web UI for instant switching.
- **GatewayProvider consolidation** - single WebSocket replaces 5–7 per page in the web UI.

### ⚡ Performance
- **8–20s daemon GET latency → <100ms** during active turns. Root causes fixed:
  - Ring-buffer PTY scrollback (was O(N) string realloc per data chunk → O(1) chunk-list ring)
  - Transcript backfill made async + transactional (was sync `readFileSync` + N inserts per GET)
  - Async transcript tail with long-lived `FileHandle` (was sync `statSync`+`openSync`+`readSync` per file-watch event)
- **Web event-storm fix** - `events` array narrowed to frames consumers actually filter on; high-frequency consumers migrated to direct `subscribe()` callbacks.
- **rAF-coalesced xterm window resize**, `hasOutput` short-circuit, static-import for hook endpoint.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Tab status no longer goes stale** - chat tabs subscribe to session lifecycle events; blue "in progress" dot clears on completion and survives reload.
- **No more title flash on tab click** - `sessionMeta` now tagged with its owning sessionId; effect refuses to write stale meta onto the newly-selected tab.
- **Orphan tabs after sidebar delete** - `session:deleted` events now close matching tabs.
- **Reconcile persisted tabs on load** - drops orphans, normalizes stale `running` status against authoritative server state.
- **Rate-limit wait cancels on user stop** - was only catching `"error"` status, missed the `"idle"` user-initiated stop case.
- **Heartbeat clears after session delete** - no more `status:"running"` writes against deleted rows.
- **Hook endpoint hardening** - loopback check moved ahead of body read, 64 KB body cap, `crypto.timingSafeEqual` secret comparison, empty-secret bypass guard.
- **File-mode 0o600 on `gateway.json`, `--settings`, and `~/.claude.json`** - hook secret no longer world-readable on shared machines.
- **HookRegistry buffer GC** - periodic sweep evicts entries whose TTL expired; closes long-running memory leak.
- **`streams` map cleanup on PTY exit**, **kill-mid-paste race closed** (`turnStarted` before `injectPrompt`), **PTY-reset control frame** sent to xterm on respawn, **async-tailer fd nulled on read error**.

### 🪄 Docs
- New README section: **"How the Claude engine works under the hood"** - PTY, hooks, transcript tail, KEEP ALIVE, Chat/CLI duality, and why we moved off `claude -p` before the subscription cutoff.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### ✨ Features
- Connector abstraction layer - connectors declare capabilities (threading, reactions, edits, attachments) and health status
- `replyMessage()` vs `sendMessage()` split - proper thread-aware message routing
- CronConnector - cron jobs are now message sources routed through SessionManager (unified flow)
- Slack config options - `shareSessionInChannel`, `allowFrom` whitelist, `ignoreOldMessagesOnBoot`

### 💥 Breaking Changes
- `Connector` interface expanded with new required methods: `replyMessage()`, `getCapabilities()`, `getHealth()`, `reconstructTarget()`
- `IncomingMessage` and `Session` types have new required fields
- `GET /api/connectors` response shape changed from `string[]` to objects with capabilities
- `startScheduler()` now takes `SessionManager` instead of engine map
- `sendMessage()` no longer posts to threads - use `replyMessage()`

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-09

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Remove `@jinn/web` workspace dependency from published package - was causing `unsupported URL type "workspace:"` error on `npm i -g jinn-cli` (web UI is embedded as static files during build, not a runtime dependency)

### 🔧 Improvements
- Claude engine now runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` - prevents sessions from hanging on tool approval prompts in headless mode

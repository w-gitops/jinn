- Net: 81 files changed, +5,608 / -8,723 lines

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-10

### 🔧 Improvements
- Codex engine now runs with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` — prevents Jimmy-managed Codex sessions from being constrained by CLI sandbox/approval defaults

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### ✨ Features
- Connector abstraction layer — connectors declare capabilities (threading, reactions, edits, attachments) and health status
- `replyMessage()` vs `sendMessage()` split — proper thread-aware message routing
- CronConnector — cron jobs are now message sources routed through SessionManager (unified flow)
- Slack config options — `shareSessionInChannel`, `allowFrom` whitelist, `ignoreOldMessagesOnBoot`
- Transport state tracking — new `transportState` field + queue depth visibility
- In-chat slash commands — `/cron list|run|enable|disable`, `/model <name>`, `/doctor`
- Runtime cron control — trigger/enable/disable jobs without restart
- Web UI: Slack settings toggles for new config options
- Web UI: Transport visibility — connector name, queue depth, transport state badges

### 🔧 Improvements
- Unified message routing — all sources flow through `SessionManager.route()` with uniform `IncomingMessage`
- Cron runner simplified — ~35% code reduction by delegating to SessionManager
- Capability-aware decorations — reactions/edits conditional on connector capabilities
- Config token masking — Slack tokens masked in `GET /api/config`
- Session queue monitoring — `getPendingCount()` and `getTransportState()`

### 🏗️ Infrastructure
- Build pipeline — web UI bundled into gateway dist
- Test suite — threads, queue, and registry tests using Node.js native test runner
- DB migration — auto-adds connector/transport columns, backfills from legacy fields

### 💥 Breaking Changes
- `Connector` interface expanded with new required methods: `replyMessage()`, `getCapabilities()`, `getHealth()`, `reconstructTarget()`
- `IncomingMessage` and `Session` types have new required fields
- `GET /api/connectors` response shape changed from `string[]` to objects with capabilities
- `startScheduler()` now takes `SessionManager` instead of engine map
- `sendMessage()` no longer posts to threads — use `replyMessage()`

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-09

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Remove `@jinn/web` workspace dependency from published package — was causing `unsupported URL type "workspace:"` error on `npm i -g jinn-cli` (web UI is embedded as static files during build, not a runtime dependency)

### 🔧 Improvements
- Claude engine now runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — prevents sessions from hanging on tool approval prompts in headless mode
